      <h3>Lyrics</h3>
      <p>
        Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover<br />
        Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that (ooh)<br />
        Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother<br />
        Hot like summer, yeah, I'm making you sweat like that (break it down)<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Ooh, when I look in the mirror<br />
        I'll melt your heart into two<br />
        I got that superstar glow, so<br />
        Ooh (do the boogie, like)<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Side step, right-left, to my beat<br />
        High like the moon, rock with me, baby<br />
        Know that I got that heat<br />
        Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap<br />
        Side step, right-left, to my beat<br />
        Get it, let it roll<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other<br />
        Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad<br />
        Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber<br />
        Straight up, I (got ya)<br />
        Making you fall like that (break it down)<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Ooh, when I look in the mirror<br />
        I'll melt your heart into two<br />
        I got that superstar glow, so<br />
        Ooh (do the boogie, like)<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Side step, right-left, to my beat<br />
        High like the moon, rock with me, baby<br />
        Know that I got that heat<br />
        Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap<br />
        Side step, right-left, to my beat<br />
        Get it, let it roll
      </p>
      <p>
        Get it, let it roll
      </p>
      <p>
        Get it, let it roll
      </p>
      <p>
        Ice on my wrist, I'm that nice guy<br />
        Got that right body and that right mind<br />
        Rolling up to party, got the right vibe<br />
        Smooth like (butter), hate us (love us)<br />
        Fresh, boy, pull up and we lay low<br />
        All the players get moving when the bass low<br />
        Got ARMY right behind us when we say so<br />
        Let's go
      </p>
      <p>
        Side step, right-left, to my beat (right-left, to my beat)<br />
        High like the moon, rock with me, baby<br />
        Know that I got that heat<br />
        Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (you know that talk is cheap)<br />
        Side step, right-left, to my beat<br />
        Get it, let it roll<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Smooth like (butter), cool shade (stunner)<br />
        And you know we don't stop<br />
        Hot like (summer), ain't no (bummer)<br />
        You'll be like, "Oh my God"<br />
        We gon' make you rock, and you say (yeah)<br />
        We gon' make you bounce, and you say (yeah)<br />
        Hotter? Sweeter! Cooler? Butter!
      </p>
      <p>
        Get it, let it roll
      </p>
